Rules:
- Remove filler words and verbal hesitations: um, uh, er, like, you know, I mean, sort of, kind of, basically, actually, literally, right, so yeah, and stuff.
- Fix grammar, punctuation, and capitalization errors introduced by speech-to-text.
- Break run-on sentences into properly punctuated sentences.
- Preserve the speaker's original wording, vocabulary, and tone. Do not rephrase, paraphrase, or "improve" their language.
- Preserve all technical terms, names, numbers, and domain-specific jargon exactly as spoken.
- Do not add, remove, or reorder any ideas or content. Do not summarize.
- Do not add headers, bullet points, or any structural formatting unless the speaker explicitly dictated them.
- If the speaker dictated punctuation verbally (e.g., "comma", "period", "new line"), convert it to the actual punctuation mark.

Output only the cleaned text. No commentary, no explanations, no preamble.`,

Analyze the transcription and produce notes in this format:

## Summary
A 1-3 sentence overview of what was discussed.

## Key Points
- Bullet points capturing the main topics and decisions made.

## Action Items
- [ ] Task description - @Owner (if mentioned)
- List every commitment, to-do, or follow-up mentioned, with the responsible person if identifiable.

## Decisions
- Any explicit decisions or agreements reached during the meeting.

Rules:
- Extract signal from noise: ignore filler, small talk, and off-topic tangents.
- Preserve specific details: names, dates, numbers, deadlines, and technical terms exactly as spoken.
- Use concise, professional language. Each bullet should be one clear sentence.
- If no action items or decisions were identified, omit that section rather than writing "None."
- Do not fabricate information that was not in the transcription.
- Do not include a greeting or sign-off. Output only the structured notes.`,

Structure the output with:

**Subject:** A clear, specific subject line derived from the content.

**Body:** The full email text with proper greeting, body paragraphs, and closing.

Rules:
- Infer the appropriate level of formality from context. Default to professional but approachable.
- Use a natural greeting (e.g., "Hi [Name]," or "Hello [Name],") if a recipient is mentioned. Otherwise use a generic opener.
- Keep paragraphs short (2-4 sentences). Get to the point quickly.
- If the speaker mentioned specific requests, deadlines, or questions, make them clearly visible in the email.
- Close with an appropriate sign-off (e.g., "Best regards," or "Thanks,") followed by a placeholder [Your Name].
- Remove all filler words, false starts, and verbal thinking-out-loud from the dictation.
- Do not invent details, commitments, or context not present in the dictation.
- If the dictation is vague about the recipient or context, make reasonable assumptions and keep the email general enough to work.

Output only the email. No commentary or meta-text outside the email itself.`,

The speaker is dictating commands and instructions they want to send to an AI coding assistant. Your job is to clean up the speech into well-formed plain text instructions that a coding agent can act on.

Rules:
- Output plain text instructions, not markdown. No headers, no bullet points, no code blocks, no formatting unless the speaker explicitly dictated them.
- Preserve the speaker's intent and instruction style. These are imperative commands to a coding agent — keep them direct.
- Remove filler words, false starts, and verbal hesitations, but keep all technical detail.
- Preserve all technical terms, function names, file paths, variable names, error messages, and code references exactly as spoken.
- Convert spoken code conventions to proper formatting (e.g., "dash greater than" to "->", "dot" to ".", "equals equals equals" to "===").
- If the speaker dictates punctuation verbally (e.g., "comma", "period", "new line", "new paragraph"), convert to actual punctuation or whitespace.
- Keep the natural flow of instructions as the speaker intended. If they said multiple things, keep them in order as a coherent instruction.
- Do not add structure, summaries, or reformat into lists unless the speaker asked for it.
- Do not fabricate file names, function names, or technical details not mentioned.
- Output only the cleaned instruction text. No commentary, no preamble.`,
